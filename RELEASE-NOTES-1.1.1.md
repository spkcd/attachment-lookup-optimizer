# Release Notes v1.1.1 - BunnyCDN Offload PHP Warnings Fix

**Release Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Author**: SPARKWEB Studio ([https://sparkwebstudio.com](https://sparkwebstudio.com))

## 🛠️ Critical PHP Warnings Fix

### Issue Resolution
- **FIXED**: Resolved critical PHP warnings that occurred during BunnyCDN file offloading process
- **ERROR TYPES**: `exif_imagetype(): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory` and `file_get_contents(): Failed to open stream: No such file or directory`
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Timing conflict between BunnyCDN local file deletion and WordPress core image processing operations

### Technical Problem Analysis

#### The Issue
The BunnyCDN offload feature was causing PHP warnings because:

1. ✅ **BunnyCDN Upload**: Files successfully uploaded to CDN
2. ✅ **Local File Deletion**: Plugin immediately deleted local files 
3. ❌ **WordPress Core Processing**: Still trying to access deleted files for EXIF data extraction and image processing

This created a race condition where WordPress core functions in `functions.php` (lines 3338 and 3358) attempted to read files that had already been deleted.

#### The Solution
**Delayed File Deletion System**: Implemented a sophisticated delayed deletion mechanism that ensures WordPress completes all image processing before local files are removed.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Components Added

1. **Delayed Deletion Scheduling**
   ```php
   private function schedule_delayed_file_deletion($attachment_id) {
       update_post_meta($attachment_id, '_alo_pending_offload', true);
   }
   ```

2. **Safe Deletion Trigger**
   ```php
   add_filter('wp_generate_attachment_metadata', [$this, 'handle_metadata_generation_complete'], 99, 2);
   ```

3. **Completion Handler**
   ```php
   public function handle_metadata_generation_complete($metadata, $attachment_id) {
       $pending_offload = get_post_meta($attachment_id, '_alo_pending_offload', true);
       if ($pending_offload) {
           delete_post_meta($attachment_id, '_alo_pending_offload');
           $this->delete_local_files_after_upload($attachment_id);
       }
       return $metadata;
   }
   ```

### Files Updated

Applied the delayed deletion fix across **6 core BunnyCDN components**:

- ✅ **UploadPreprocessor.php** - Upload processing with delayed deletion
- ✅ **BunnyCDNManager.php** - Core CDN manager with metadata hook
- ✅ **BunnyCDNSyncController.php** - Batch sync operations  
- ✅ **BunnyCDNCronSync.php** - Background cron sync
- ✅ **BunnyCDNMigrator.php** - Bulk migration tools
- ✅ **MediaLibraryEnhancer.php** - Admin interface retry functionality

### Process Flow

#### Before (Problematic):
```
Upload to CDN → Delete Local Files → WordPress tries to process deleted files → PHP WARNINGS
```

#### After (Fixed):
```
Upload to CDN → Mark for delayed deletion → WordPress processes files → Safe deletion → Clean operation
```
