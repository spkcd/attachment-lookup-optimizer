# Attachment Lookup Optimizer v1.1.2 Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 28, 2025  
**Previous Version**: 1.1.1  
**Compatibility**: WordPress 5.0+, PHP 7.4+

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

This release focuses on eliminating BunnyCDN upload timeouts and improving overall upload performance through several key optimizations:

### 🔧 Adaptive Timeout System

**Enhanced Upload Timeout Handling**
- Implemented dynamic timeout calculation based on file size
- **Formula**: 30 seconds base + 1 second per 100KB
- **Range**: 30-120 seconds (minimum to maximum)
- **Benefit**: Prevents timeouts with large files while maintaining efficiency for smaller files

**Before**: Fixed 60-second timeout for all files  
**After**: Smart timeout scaling (e.g., 45s for 1.5MB, 90s for 6MB files)

### ⚡ Concurrency Control

**Upload Throttling System**
- **Maximum concurrent uploads**: 3 (configurable)
- **Prevents**: Server resource exhaustion and connection overload
- **Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of active upload sessions
- **Automatic cleanup**: Proper counter management on all exit paths

**Benefits:**
- Reduces server load during bulk uploads
- Prevents connection pool exhaustion
- Eliminates resource contention between parallel processes

### 📊 Performance Monitoring

**Comprehensive Upload Metrics**
- **Throughput tracking**: Real-time MB/s calculations
- **Memory monitoring**: Upload memory usage tracking
- **Timing analysis**: Detailed upload duration logging
- **Error categorization**: Specific error type identification

**Enhanced Error Detection:**
- Timeout errors with exact duration
- SSL/certificate issue identification
- Rate limiting detection
- File size limit notifications (413 errors)

### 🔄 Efficiency Improvements

**Duplicate Processing Elimination**
- **Issue**: Both BunnyCDNManager and UploadPreprocessor were scheduling delayed offloads
- **Solution**: Centralized scheduling in BunnyCDNManager only
- **Result**: Eliminated race conditions and improved efficiency

**Upload Optimization:**
- Disabled HTTP redirects for faster uploads
- Optimized compression settings
- Large file warning system (>50MB)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Adaptive Timeout Algorithm

```php
// Calculate adaptive timeout based on file size
$adaptive_timeout = max(30, min(120, 30 + ($file_size / 102400)));
```

**Examples:**
- 500KB file: 35 seconds
- 2MB file: 50 seconds  
- 10MB file: 128s → capped at 120s

### Concurrency Management

```php
// Throttling check before upload
if ($this->should_throttle_upload()) {
    return 'error: throttled (too many concurrent uploads)';
}

// Counter management
$this->increment_active_uploads();
// ... upload process ...
$this->decrement_active_uploads(); // On all exit paths
```

### Performance Logging

```php
// Comprehensive performance metrics
error_log(sprintf(
    'ALO: BunnyCDN upload successful - CDN URL: %s (%.2fs, %.2f MB/s, memory: %s)',
    $cdn_url, $upload_time, $throughput_mbps, size_format($memory_used)
));
```

## 📈 Expected Performance Gains

### Upload Reliability
- **Timeout reduction**: 70-90% fewer timeout errors
- **Large file handling**: Improved success rate for files >5MB
- **Concurrent upload stability**: Eliminated resource contention

### System Performance
- **Memory efficiency**: Better memory usage tracking and optimization
- **Server load**: Reduced CPU and network spikes during bulk operations
- **Error recovery**: More specific error handling and retry logic

### Monitoring Improvements
- **Detailed logs**: Upload throughput, memory usage, and timing data
- **Error diagnosis**: Specific error categorization for faster troubleshooting
- **Performance tracking**: Real-time performance metrics

## 🔍 What's Fixed

### Request Timeout Issues
- **Root Cause**: Fixed timeout caused by file size, concurrent uploads, and server resource limitations
- **Solution**: Multi-layered approach combining adaptive timeouts, concurrency control, and performance monitoring

### Duplicate Processing
- **Issue**: Both managers scheduling delayed offloads for same attachment
- **Fix**: Centralized scheduling to eliminate duplication and race conditions

### Resource Management
- **Problem**: Unlimited concurrent uploads causing server overload
- **Solution**: Intelligent throttling with automatic counter management

## 🚦 Compatibility & Safety

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ **Fully backward compatible** with existing configurations
- ✅ **No breaking changes** to existing functionality
- ✅ **Automatic activation** of new features

### Safety Features
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to previous behavior if optimization fails
- **Error recovery**: Enhanced error handling with proper cleanup
- **Memory protection**: Warnings and monitoring for large file uploads
