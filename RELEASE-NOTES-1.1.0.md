# Release Notes v1.1.0 - Critical Fixes & Stability

**Release Date**: January 20, 2025  
**Author**: SPARKWEB Studio ([https://sparkwebstudio.com](https://sparkwebstudio.com))

## üõ†Ô∏è Critical Bug Fixes

### Fatal Error Resolution
- **FIXED**: Resolved critical fatal error `"Call to undefined function AttachmentLookupOptimizer\get_current_screen()"` that occurred during WordPress initialization
- **ROOT CAUSE**: The error was triggered when JetFormBuilder called `get_posts()` during early WordPress initialization, which activated the `pre_get_posts` filter before admin functions were loaded
- **SOLUTION**: Added comprehensive safety checks and delayed hook registration to prevent premature admin function calls

### MediaLibraryEnhancer Stability Improvements
- **ENHANCED**: Added `function_exists('get_current_screen')` and `did_action('admin_init')` safety checks
- **IMPROVED**: Wrapped `pre_get_posts` hook registration in `admin_init` callback to ensure proper timing
- **RESULT**: Plugin now safely handles early WordPress initialization scenarios without fatal errors

## üé® Admin Interface Improvements

### HTML Compliance Fixes
- **RESOLVED**: Fixed 13 duplicate HTML ID warnings for `alo_nonce` fields causing DOM validation errors
- **ENHANCED**: All admin forms now use unique nonce field IDs with descriptive suffixes:
  - `alo_nonce_quick_setup` (for quick setup form)
  - `alo_nonce_clear_cache` (for clear cache form)
  - `alo_nonce_test_cache` (for test cache form)
  - `alo_nonce_rebuild_table` (for rebuild table form)
  - And 10+ other unique IDs for each form
- **UPDATED**: Corresponding `wp_verify_nonce()` checks to use the new unique field names
- **RESULT**: Clean admin interface with no HTML validation warnings
